  <p>Welcome to my attempt at coming up with a reproducible
outline that will allow any non-programmer to
become a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer">software developer</a>
 in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language">Ruby programming language</a>
and get a job writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web applications</a> using
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Ruby on Rails framework</a>.</p>

<p>As we all know, computers have become a large part of
our lives.  Behind all of those computers, lie an army
of people that tell those computers what to do.  Many
people think that what we do as software developers
is magic.  My goal is to show people that it is not
magic and it indeed a skill that can be learned by
anyone who wants to put in the effort to do so.</p>

<p>I am as new to teaching non-programmers how to
become effective software developers as you
are at programming in Ruby. I am looking to get enough
people to participate in this little “experiment” so that
I can refine this outline to make it more effective.  In
order to do that, I am asking that you will share your
feedback with me as you progress.  I have been developing
software for almost 15 years now so I have a different
view on the steps needed to learn to program than say
an unemployed carpenter or a stay at home mom who has never programmed at all.</p>

<p>You may be asking why you would want to learn to become
a software developer in Ruby.  There are many
reasons: it is a fun job, it pays well, you are
constantly learning, etc.  Here is a link that shows what the
average Ruby on Rails developer is paid:
<a href="http://www.simplyhired.com/a/salary/search/q-ruby+on+rails+developer">http://www.simplyhired.com/a/salary/search/q-ruby+on+rails+developer</a></p>

<p>If you want to see how many jobs there are out there for
Ruby on Rails developers, just type “ruby on rails job openings” into
Google and you will see.</p>

<p>If you are interested in chatting more about this program, please
reach out to me via <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
My user name there is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mikegehard">mikegehard</a>.  Please
include the <a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/49309-what-are-hashtags-symbols">hashtag</a>
“<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23newrubydevs">#newrubydevs</a>” in your
tweet so I can track what people are saying about this program.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance and I look forward to your feedback and questions.</p>

<p>Please check back often as I hope that the outline will continue to evolve
with help from all of you.  To submit changes, please use GitHub to
submit a <a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">pull request</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/msgehard/my_octopress_blog">the repository</a> or
contact me on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Your assignments&#8230;should you choose to accept them</h2>

<p>Please follow the instructions to the letter.  Part of being a great software developer is the ability to
follow directions and attention to detail.</p>

<h3>Learn about the command line interface (aka CLI) in your operating system (OS) of your choice</h3>

<p>Many computer users don&#8217;t know that there is a way to interact with a computer outside of the graphical
user interface (GUI) that we have become so used to.  It is called the command line interface.  If you
need a little help navigating this new world, or even a refresher about some aspects of it, check out
the <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/">CLI Crash Course</a>.</p>

<h3>Learn Git and <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a></h3>

<p>Source control management (SCM) systems are part of the daily life of a sofware developer. This is the place that all of our work lives.
One of the more widely used SCMs is called Git. You will learn about source control in Git as your first assignment.</p>

<h4>Install Git on your system</h4>

<ol>
<li>Try to follow the Mac instructions and let me know if you have any questions.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Get basic background in Ruby</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/msgehard/LearnRubyTheHardWay">this repository</a> and
clone your fork into a directory on computer.

<ul>
<li>For help check out <a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finish each exercise at <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a>

<ul>
<li>All files that you write for Learn Ruby the Hard Way should be saved into the directory that was created when
you cloned your fork of the repository.</li>
<li>Each exercise should be in its own file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you complete an exercise, push the changed exercise file to your fork of the LeanRubyTheHardWay repository.

<ul>
<li>Make some notes in the commit message about your thoughts of the exercise, what was hard, what was easy, include some links to any extra information you found on the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>If you have questions about an exercise, follow these steps for submitting your questions via GitHub:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://progit.org/book/ch3-0.html">Create a new branch in your local Git repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://progit.org/book/ch2-2.html">Commit the changes to that branch</a> with some comments about what is confusing you</li>
<li><a href="http://progit.org/book/ch2-5.html">Push those changes to a remote branch on Github</a></li>
<li><a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">Submit a pull request</a> so I know that you have questions</li>
</ol>


<p>We will then use comments in that pull request to as the first mechanism to talk about the issue.  If we need to chat either on Skype or face to face we can do that as well.</p>

<h3>Begin to understand test driven development in Ruby</h3>

<p>Testing in important in the Ruby community for many reasons. I could talk your ear off about this so please email me to set up a time to chat about it if you’d like to hear more.</p>

<ol>
<li>Read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven development</a></li>
<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">this repository</a> to your computer</li>
<li>Read the README.rdoc to get started</li>
</ol>


<h3>Gain some insight about how to approach the huge universe of information about software</h3>

<p>Now you&#8217;ve got some Ruby chops and you should feel pretty confident about your ability to at least be
able to read and write some basic Ruby. This gift comes with a price. The Internet is chock full of tutorials
and information about learning programming languages. Take a moment to
read <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/12/29/stop-reading-this-blog-and-learn-something/">this blog post</a> so you
don&#8217;t drown in this huge pool of information.</p>

<h3>Learn to build a website in Ruby on Rails</h3>

<ol>
<li>Read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">the history of Ruby on Rails</a></li>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/msgehard/RubyOnRailsTutorial">this repository</a></li>
<li>Clone the fork to your computer</li>
<li>Work thorugh the book. As you complete your exercises, push your changes to your fork of the
repo.</li>
<li>If you run into an issue, create a separate branch for the issue, push the branch to Github and
submit a pull request so I can help out.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Refine your knowledge about how to build a website in Ruby on Rails</h3>

<p>Rails is a great framework for quickly building web applications. As Rails projects grow, they
suffer some maintainability problems. Get a copy of
<a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">Objects on Rails</a>
and begin to refine your knowledge of how Rails apps are built.</p>

<h3>Begin to think about a career in software development</h3>

<p>You are beginning to have the skills it takes to become a software developer. You may still be a ways off
from looking for a job doing software development but it is never too early to start thinking about it.
Pick up a copy of Chad Fowler&#8217;s book
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">&#8220;The Passionate Programmer&#8221;</a> and learn some things
about how to think about your career in software development.</p>

<h3>Let&#8217;s build something together</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve come a long way and now it&#8217;s time to get serious. You&#8217;ve got some skills and now it is time to hone them
to a sharp edge. Think of a problem that could be solved by a web based application. It&#8217;s time to start building
that application. When you get to this step, reach out to me via Twitter (mikegehard) and we&#8217;ll start the
discussion about how we are going to pair to build your application.</p>
